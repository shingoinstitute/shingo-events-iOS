#Shingo Events App for iOS

<h4><strong>Important Information</strong></h4>
<p>This app uses cocoapods to install packages needed to make the app run. Because of this, when you import this repository into Xcode you must open the project from 'Shingo Events.xcworkspace'. If you open it from the regular .xcodeproj project file, it will not compile.</p>

<p>If you open the project from the correct project folder and it still does not compile, make sure you have cocoapods installed on your system, and in a terminal window move to the working directory you stored the project under and type "pod install".</p>

<p>This repository holds the code for the Shingo Events iOS app for the <i>Shingo Institute</i> at Utah State University. This branch contains the most current and stable release of the app.</p>

<h4><strong>Shingo Events API</strong></h4>

<p>This app pulls a majority of its data from the Shingo Institute API. Documentation can be found <a href="https://docs.shingo.org/#/projects/1">here</a>.</p>
